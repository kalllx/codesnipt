first 

JDBC     java
DATE 	java.sql.Date
TIME 	java.sql.Time
TIMESTAMP 	java.sql.Timestamp
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

above is the mapping relationship jdbc and java used in etmvc.

however sqlite has dynamic type.
all date is store in number.


because reading date type field from rs. in sqlite jdbc driver ,and  convert number to yyyy-mm-dd formate

must use getDate\getTime\getStamTime 

etmvc use all with getObject.

getString or getObject for date field may work on other db.but not sqlite/

etmvc get the number string instead

this is need to convert to according date Object.
but the converter is used in ui(yyyy-mm-dd) and db select(number). so the datebinder need
cumstomer redefined.


   user = (User)User.updateModel(user, this.request.getParameterMap());
   
***why ui need db convert as ui has binder.(this is a bad smell)

_______________________________
so for etmvc used in sqlite 
need to refactor dataConveter


 a DataBinder.java  is used in UI
 
 a DataConverter.java  is used in DB
 
 	   Model
 	 / 		 \
	binder   conveter
 	/		  \
 [UI]      	  [DB]
